# FLIGHT-DELAY-PREDCTION-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING-AND-DEEP-LEARNING

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict flight delays using machine learning and deep learning techniques. By analyzing historical flight data, weather conditions, and other relevant factors, the model provides estimated delays for flights, helping airlines and passengers plan better.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Feature engineering for better model performance
- Implementation of various machine learning models (Decision Trees, Random Forests, etc.)
- Deep learning approach using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
- Performance evaluation and comparison of different models

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization
- Scikit-learn for machine learning models
- TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning models
- Jupyter Notebook for development

## Dataset
The dataset consists of historical flight data, including:
- Flight number and airline information
- Departure and arrival airports
- Scheduled and actual departure/arrival times
- Weather conditions
- Other relevant delay-related factors

## Model Performance
- Machine learning models were evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared.
- Deep learning models, particularly LSTM, were fine-tuned to achieve better predictions.
